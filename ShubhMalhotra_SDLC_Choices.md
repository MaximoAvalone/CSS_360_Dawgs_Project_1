# SDLC Model Justifications by Shubh Malhotra

Below is a list of each project scenario, the recommended SDLC model, and a justification explaining why that model is appropriate.

## #1: New e-Commerce Site  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Agile (Scrum / Incremental)  
Agile is well-suited for this project because features that customers see like customization and outfit matching are likely to evolve based on user feedback. Incremental development allows the team to deliver core functionality early while coordinating extensions with a separate group.

## #2: Dental Office Site  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Agile (Incremental)  
The website begins with simple, well-understood requirements but is expected to grow over time with additional features. An incremental Agile approach allows for gradual delivery and enhancement without strict deadlines.

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** V-Model  
This software is safety-critical and must be thoroughly tested and validated at every stage of development. The V-Model ensures the following of requirements and verification activities, which is necessary for long-term reliability and safe behavior in case anything happens.

## #4: Department of Transportation  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Waterfall  
This project is based on a detailed and stable specification with a fixed schedule and experienced staff. The Waterfall model provides a structured, sequential process that aligns well with constant expectations and predictable outcomes.

---

## #5: Reducing Traffic  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Spiral  
The project involves significant technical risk due to real-time data processing, distributed systems, and hardware integration. The Spiral model emphasizes risk assessment and prototyping, which helps manage uncertainty while using the team’s expertise.

## #6: Educational Game  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Agile (Scrum)  
Requirements are preliminary and constantly evolving, and early delivery is needed for customer testing and feedback. Scrum allows for rapid iteration and close collaboration with educators (a separate group) to refine gameplay and educational effectiveness.

## #7: Global Health  
**Recommended SDLC Model:** Lean  
With a small team and uncertain requirements, Lean development focuses on delivering the most value for the least waste. Rapid experimentation, validation, and learning help demonstrate real-world health impact and also helps support future funding opportunities.
