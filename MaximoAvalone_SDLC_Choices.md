# #1: New e-Commerce site
I would recommend the Agile development process. Agile development is well suited for projects where requirements are expected to change because customer needs change and play an important role in shaping the final product. An e-Commerce site is the perfect environment for Agile because updates can realistically be pushed on a regular basis.

# #2: Dental office site
I would recommend the Incremental development process. Incremental development works well when a system can be built in stages, starting with basic functionality and expanding over time. This fits the needs of the dentist perfectly, start by implementing the ability to make appointments and over time develop and implement the remaining features incrementally.

# #3: Nuclear Power Plant
I would recommend the Spiral development process. Spiral is good for high risk situations because it focuses on risk analysis which is very important for a Nuclear Power Plant.

# #4: Department of Transportation
I would recommend the Waterfall development process. Waterfall is effective when requirements are clearly defined and stable from the beginning. This project aligns perfectly with this because of the fact that the Department of Transportation has strict guidelines that won’t change.

# #5: Reducing Traffic
I would recommend the Spiral development process. Spiral is well suited for projects with high technical complexity and risk. Spiral makes sense for projects that are incorporating hardware and software.

# #6: Educational game
I would recommend the Agile development process. Agile is perfect for environments where testing is emphasised and updating based on user requirements and feedback is critical. This is perfect for the case of the Educational game.

# #7: Global Health
I would recommend the Agile development process. Agile is perfect for small teams (which perfectly aligns with the situation). Another good aspect of Agile in the context of the project is that agile is good for quickly delivering software that is usable and then continuing to update it based on user feedback.
