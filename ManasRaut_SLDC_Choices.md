# SDLC Model Selection Report  



## Project #1: New e-Commerce Site  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Incremental / Agile**

An incremental or agile model is best because the system is user-facing and highly interactive, with features like customization and outfit matching that benefit from early user feedback. Additionally, the company already has existing templates and infrastructure, making it practical to deliver the site in increments while coordinating new scripting extensions with a separate development team.



## Project #2: Dental Office Site  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Incremental**

An incremental model is best because the initial requirements are simple and well understood, while future features such as online appointments and automated reminders can be added over time. The client is flexible with delivery time and expects ongoing enhancements, which aligns well with incremental development.



## Project #3: Nuclear Power Plant  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Waterfall (Plan-Driven)**

A plan-driven waterfall model is best because of the safety-critical nature of the system and the severe consequences of failure. The need for extensive verification, robustness, long system lifespan, and regulatory compliance requires detailed upfront specification, documentation, and validation before deployment.



## Project #4: Department of Transportation  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Waterfall (Plan-Driven)**

A waterfall model is best because it is based on a detailed and stable 100-page specification, and the organization has prior experience with similar systems. The fixed timeline, defined scope, and experienced team favor a structured, plan-driven approach with clearly defined phases.



## Project #5: Reducing Traffic  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Incremental with Prototyping**

An incremental model with early prototyping is best because the system involves complex integration of hardware, networking, and real-time data processing. Prototypes can help validate assumptions about sensors, GPS tracking, and displays while allowing the system to evolve as technical challenges are better understood.



## Project #6: Educational Game  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Agile**

Agile development is best because requirements are evolving and the goal is rapid delivery of playable versions for testing by internal and external users. Frequent feedback from teachers and administrators allows the team to refine gameplay, educational value, and usability through short development iterations.



## Project #7: Global Health  
**Chosen SDLC Model:** **Agile / Incremental**

An agile or incremental approach is best because of the small initial team, evolving requirements, and uncertainty around long-term goals tied to grant funding. Early releases can demonstrate impact quickly, which is critical for securing additional funding, while allowing the system to adapt to real-world conditions in developing regions.
