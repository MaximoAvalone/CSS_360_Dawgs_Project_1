## 1: New e-Commerce site

> **Selected SDLC**: Incremental Development

**Justification**: The company wants to add cool features like custom colors and design tools. Starting with basic shopping first and then adding features step by step makes sense. This lets them test with real customers early and adjust based on feedback. It also helps manage the mixed team of experienced developers and new interns.

## 2: Dental office site

> **Selected SDLC**: Agile Development

**Justification**: The dentist friend is flexible with timing and wants to keep adding new features over time. Agile works great because they can see working versions quickly and decide what to add next. Since requirements will keep changing as they figure out what patients want, agile handles that perfectly.

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant

> **Selected SDLC**: Waterfall Model

**Justification**: Safety is extremely critical here - mistakes could be dangerous. Everything needs to be planned, documented and tested thoroughly before building anything. The waterfall method ensures all safety checks happen upfront and creates the detailed documentation needed for a system that must last 10+ years.
