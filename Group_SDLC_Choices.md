# Group Project Analysis Decisions - Dawgs

This section shows the SDLC choices our team agreed on for each project. For each project we show which model we picked, why we picked it, what other models we looked at and the main reasons for our choice.

---

## 1: New e-Commerce site

> **Final SDLC**: Incremental

**Justification**:  
We picked Incremental because this project is customer facing and features may change based on user feedback. Delivering the site in small steps allows the team to release a working product early and improve it over time. It also works well with a mixed team and coordination with the separate interpreter group.

**Other models considered**:  
- Waterfall - Too rigid for changes  
- Spiral - Not necessary since risk is low  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Customer feedback affects features  
2. Features can be added in small stages

## 2: Dental office site

> **Final SDLC**: Incremental

**Justification**:  
Incremental works well because the initial website is simple, and extra features like appointments or reminders can be added later. The client is flexible on timing which fits gradual development.

**Other models considered**:  
- Agile - More overhead than needed  
- Waterfall - Too rigid for future changes  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Features will grow gradually  
2. Flexible delivery timeline

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant

> **Final SDLC**: Waterfall

**Justification**:  
We chose Waterfall because the system is safety critical. Everything must be carefully planned, tested and documented before building. This ensures reliability and regulatory compliance for the long term.

**Other models considered**:  
- Agile - Not safe for critical systems  
- Incremental - Risky without full upfront planning  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Safety and reliability are critical  
2. Long system lifespan and regulations

## 4: Department of Transportation

> **Final SDLC**: Waterfall

**Justification**:  
Waterfall fits because the project has a detailed 100 page specification, and the team has experience with similar systems. The structured approach helps meet the fixed timeline and expectations.

**Other models considered**:  
- Agile - Not needed since requirements are fixed  
- Incremental - Unnecessary due to complete specifications  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Detailed and fixed requirements  
2. Experienced team and fixed timeline  

---

## 5: Reducing Traffic

> **Final SDLC**: Spiral

**Justification**:  
Spiral is best for this project because it involves technical complexity and hardware integration. It allows testing and evaluating risks early and evolving the system gradually. 

**Other models considered**:  
- Waterfall - Too rigid for technical uncertainty  
- Agile - Less focus on formal risk analysis  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. High technical complexity  
2. Integration of hardware and software  

---

## 6: Educational game

> **Final SDLC**: Agile

**Justification**:  
Agile fits because game requirements will change based on feedback from teachers and students. The team can release playable versions quickly and improve them in short cycles.

**Other models considered**:  
- Waterfall - Too slow for frequent feedback  
- Incremental - Less flexible than Agile  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Frequent feedback from users  
2. Rapid updates and testing  

---

## 7: Global Health

> **Final SDLC**: Agile

**Justification**:  
Agile is best because the team is small and project goals may change. Early releases help show impact quickly, which is important for securing future funding. The system can adapt as conditions change in the field.

**Other models considered**:  
- Waterfall - Too rigid for changing needs  
- Spiral - Too complex for a small team  

**Key project aspects**:  
1. Small team and limited resources  
2. Need to show impact early
