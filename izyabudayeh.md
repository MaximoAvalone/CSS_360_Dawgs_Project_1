# SDLC Model Selection Report


## Individual Section – SDLC Choices and Justifications
---

## #1: New e-Commerce site  
I would recommend the **Agile (Scrum)** development process. Agile works well for this project because customer-facing features like customization and design options are likely to change based on user feedback. Agile also allows frequent updates while coordinating with the separate team responsible for the Java interpreter.

---

## #2: Dental office site  
I would recommend the **Incremental** development process. Incremental development fits this project because the dentist wants to start with basic features and add more over time. Since there is no strict deadline, features like online appointments and reminders can be added gradually.

---

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant  
I would recommend the **V-Model** development process. This model is appropriate because the software must be extremely reliable and safe due to the high risks involved. The V-Model emphasizes verification and validation at every stage, which is critical for safety-critical systems.

---

## #4: Department of Transportation  
I would recommend the **Waterfall** development process. Waterfall is a good fit because the project has very detailed and fixed requirements provided by the Department of Transportation. Since the specifications are unlikely to change, a structured and sequential approach makes sense.

---

## #5: Reducing Traffic  
I would recommend the **Spiral** development process. Spiral is well suited for this project because it involves high technical complexity, hardware integration, and significant risk. The Spiral model focuses on risk analysis while allowing iterative development.

---

## #6: Educational game  
I would recommend the **Agile** development process. Agile works well here because the game requirements are expected to evolve and user feedback from teachers and students is very important. Frequent testing and updates allow the team to improve the game quickly.

---

## #7: Global Health  
I would recommend the **Agile** development process. Agile is a strong choice because the team is small and project requirements may change as funding and real-world needs evolve. Agile allows the team to deliver usable software quickly and continue improving it based on feedback.
